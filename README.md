# 	:medal_sports: SQL Challenge Olympics History

The goal of this project was to practice my skills of writing SQL queries based on a real dataset. I was completing this challenge as I was improving my knowledge of SQL, so you will find in some answers more than one option of query using different strategies (subqueries, CTE's, aggregate functions, etc), as well as some comments that explain my decision-making process. 

The challenge of using olympics history dataset to write simple to complex queries is quite popular in the web, but each challenge contain different set of questions. I've based my queries on this specific challenge: https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset.

In this directory, you will find the:
- olympics history dataset;
- a list containing questions for analysis;
- the queries I've written to answer the questions above.

I've used PostegreSQL for this project.
