# SQL-olympics-challenge

The goal of this project was to practice my skills of writing SQL queries based on a real dataset. I was completing this challenge as I was learning SQL, so you will find examples of queries in which I was exercising my knowledge of aggregate and window functions, as well as CTE's.

The challenge of using olympics history dataset to write simple to complex queries is quite popular in the web, but each challenge may contain different set of questions. I've based my queries on this specific challenge: https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset.

In this directory, you will find the:
- olympics history dataset;
- a list containing questions for analysis;
- the queries I've wrote to answer the above questions.

I've used PostegreSQL and pgAdmin 4 for this project.
